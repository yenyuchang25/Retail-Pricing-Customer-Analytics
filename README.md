# Retail-Pricing-Customer-Analytics
## Overview
This repository consolidates 3 end-to-end marketing analytics projects completed as part of the MSc Business Analytics coursework. Together, they demonstrate my ability to translate business problems into data-driven decisions, combining marketing theory, statistical analysis, and programming (R).

The projects cover the full analytics lifecycle: problem framing → data wrangling → modelling → evaluation → managerial recommendations.

## 🧋 Project 1: Customer Acquisition, Segmentation & Lifetime Value Analysis

Focus
Evaluating customer acquisition strategies and customer profitability for a new bubble tea business using customer analytics and CLV modelling.

### Key Topics & Keywords
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
- Targeted vs. Blanket Marketing
- Survey Design & Sampling Bias
- Customer Segmentation (Foodie vs. Non‑Foodie)
- Retention Rate & Purchase Frequency
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Discounting & Profitability Analysis

### What I Did
1. Computed CAC across multiple acquisition channels and compared efficiency
2. Analysed survey data to identify biases and improve data collection design
3. Conducted descriptive analytics to compare customer segments
4. Built CLV models incorporating retention, margins, and discount factors
5. Evaluated whether different customer segments are profitable to acquire
6. Assessed the financial impact of introducing a loyalty programme

### Outcome
Provided clear, quantitative recommendations on which customer segments to target, which channels to invest in, and whether loyalty programmes create incremental value.

## 📬 Project 2: Segmentation, Targeting & Predictive Modelling for Marketing ROI

Focus
Optimising targeted marketing decisions using RFM analysis, clustering, and supervised learning.

### Key Topics & Keywords
- Break‑Even Response Rate
- Marketing ROI
- RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Quantile‑based Segmentation
- K‑Means Clustering
- Feature Scaling & Pre‑processing
- Decision Tree (Supervised Learning)
- Model Comparison (ROI‑based Evaluation)

### What I Did
1. Calculated break‑even response rates to assess campaign viability
2. Implemented RFM segmentation and identified high‑response customer groups
3. Applied K‑means clustering to uncover behavioural segments
4. Built and interpreted a decision tree model to predict subscription probability
5. Compared ROI across segmentation approaches (RFM vs. K‑means vs. Decision Tree)

### Outcome
Demonstrated that model‑driven targeting (decision trees) can significantly outperform heuristic segmentation methods in terms of marketing ROI and efficiency.

## 📈 Project 3: Pricing Analytics, Causal Inference & Experiment Design

Focus
Understanding the causal impact of price and marketing actions on sales, and designing robust experiments.

### Key Topics & Keywords
- Descriptive Analytics & Visualisation
- Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM)
- Linear Regression (OLS)
- Endogeneity & Bias
- Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)
- Reverse Causality
- Instrumental Variables (IV)
- Causal Interpretation

### What I Did
1. Analysed price–sales relationships using descriptive statistics and visualisation
2. Built marketing mix models to quantify price and marketing effects
3. Identified endogeneity issues in observational data
4. Applied instrumental variable (IV) methods to estimate causal price effects
5. Designed a large‑scale A/B/N experiment, including randomisation, power analysis, and evaluation strategy

### Outcome
Showed how naïve correlations can be misleading, and how causal inference techniques lead to fundamentally different — and more reliable — business decisions.
